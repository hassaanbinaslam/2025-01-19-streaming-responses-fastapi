## About
This repository contains sample code for a blog post [Streaming Responses in FastAPI](https://hassaanbinaslam.github.io/myblog/posts/2025-01-19-streaming-responses-fastapi.html)

In this blog post, I explore how to stream responses in FastAPI using Server-Sent Events, StreamingResponse, and WebSockets. Through simple examples that simulate LLM outputs, I demonstrate how you can efficiently stream real-time data in your applications.
